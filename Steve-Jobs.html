        <br><br>
        <center><p class="writing" style="font-size: 20px;">Steven Jobs was born on February 24, 1955 in San Francisco, California, USA and died on October 5, 2011. <br><br> He was adopted by Paul Jobs(Father) and Clara Jobs(Mother). Steven Jobs spent his childhood in<br><br> Silicon Valley. He was the type of child who liked to stick to himself. He only did competitive swimming,<br><br> and no team sports. He was interested in electronics and gadgets, because he would spend a lot of time<br><br> in his neighbor's garage, who worked at Hewlett-Packard Company, (a computer company).  He attended Crittenden Middle School, <br><br>but the area that the school is in is a poor area where kids were bullied. Steve was bullied at that school. It must <br><br>have been too much for him because one day, he came home and told his adoptive parents that he wanted to <br><br>transfer schools or he would never attend school again.<br><br> He was 11 when he said this. The parents agreed and the family moved to another city, which was Los Altos, <br><br>where he was able to attend Cupertino Junior High.

<!--Early Career-->

        <center><h1 class="writing" style="font-size: 30px;"><u><b>Early Career</b></u></h1></center>
        <br><br>
        <center><p class="writing" style="font-size: 20px;">Jobs was raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California, located in what is now known as Silicon Valley. Though he was interested <br><br> in engineering, his passions of youth varied. He dropped out of Reed College, in Portland, Oregon, took a job at Atari Corporation as <br><br> a video game designer in early 1974, and saved enough money for a pilgrimage to India to experience Buddhism. Back in Silicon <br><br> Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak, a former high school friend who was working for the Hewlett-Packard Company. When <br><br> Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in designing his own computer logic board, Jobs suggested that they go into business together, <br><br> which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally turned down Wozniak’s design in 1976. The Apple I, as they called the <br><br> logic board, was built in the Jobses’ family garage with money they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s programmable calculator.</p></center>
